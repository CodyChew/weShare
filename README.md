# weShare Community Tasking App

Our team have seen many instances where NUS hostel residents struggle to juggle between work and hostel lives. We believe that residents can gather strength from the community to get errands done and quick hostel supplies. weShare seeks to bridge the gap between residents in need to other available residents.

Built with the Firebase, Angular and Node (FAN) tech stack, weShare offers a platform for requests and a targeted hostel marketplace. It also includes a real-time chat and push notifications to facilitate smoother transactions. With a focus on responsive web design, we have ensured that our web-app is compatible across laptops, tablets and even mobile.
