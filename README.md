# weShare Community Tasking App

NUS Orbital project 2020 by team SplashBros (Highest Level of Achievement - Artemis)

## Project Introduction

Our team have seen many instances where NUS hostel residents struggle to juggle between work and hostel lives. Sometimes residents are so busy with work that they don’t have time to do their laundry, get lunch, or run their errands. Getting help in group chats is difficult because they are often bombarded with many other conversations. Also, if the nearest supermarket is far away, it will be troublesome to get hostel essentials. 

Our platform seeks to simplify the process of connecting residents in the same community who need goods or services directly to those who can provide them.

## How are we different from similar platforms?
Beyond the Carousell marketplace
- Users are specific to their hostel community so products that are traded are more relevant and targeted to the residents’ needs.
- Not only do we offer goods transactions, but we also allow residents to provide and get services that they need.
- This platforms further promotes sharing and helping of one another in return for non-monetary incentives

Beyond chat apps like Telegram/WhatsApp
- Chats on our platform are more directed for the particular transaction rather than a general platform for texting
- We directly link you up to each user for each request or listing 
- You can start a chat with anyone in the community without having to know their phone number

Beyond other general community tasking platform
- Our app is focused on fulfilling the needs of hostel residents
- Even beyond the features mentioned above, there are many other features that can further ease hostel life
- This includes live tracking of dining hall crowd for residents to choose when to consume dinner (especially useful for this COVID situation)
- Training calendar for CCAs for residents to track their busy schedules

## Software Development
We revised our approach in mid-June to have individual branches for each feature for easier debugging and better structure in our project. We also considered 3 other factors when building our product: Authentication and security, User interface and User experience, Optimisations in our algorithms. We have done both alpha testing for our individual features and beta testing with a rough user base of 50 users.

## Thoughts and relfection
User Experience is a very important aspect when using this product so we try to make improvements and take user feedback when building our product.

Our web-application is currently focussed on one community, however it can be expanded to support multiple communities such as at the school or neighbourhood level.
